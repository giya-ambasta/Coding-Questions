Write a python program to get an item in a bill that has the highest price.

Items and prices are stored in dictionary format.



Note: Use Dictionary concept

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of a number of items n.

The next n lines contain an item and its price separated by spaces. (the price should be in float data type)

Output format :
The output displays an item with the highest price separated by a space.

Code constraints :
Assume only one item has the highest price.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
Rice 50
Banana 25.5
Milk 45
Tomato 15.75
Orange 60.5
Output 1 :
Orange 60.5
Input 2 :
5
zuccini 70
beetroot 20
apricot 75
Lemon 25
Onion 45
Output 2 :
apricot 75.0



q2
You are given a set A and n other sets.

your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Print true, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.



Example

Set ([1, 3, 4]) is a strict superset of set ([1, 3]).

Set ([1, 3,4]) is not a strict superset of set ([1, 3, ,4]).

Set ([1, 3, 4]) is not a strict superset of set ([1, 3, 5]).

Input format :
The first line contains the space-separated elements of set A.

The second line contains an integer number of other sets.

The next n lines contain the space-separated elements of the other sets.

Output format :
Print True if set A is a strict superset of all other N sets. Otherwise, print False.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 23 45 84 78
2
1 2 3 4 5
100 11 12
Output 1 :
False
Input 2 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 23 45 84 78
2
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
Output 2 :
True
